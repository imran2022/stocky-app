# StockyUltimate — Customizations Log

This file documents every customization made on top of the vendor
(CodeCanyon) codebase, in the order they were built. Read this before
touching any of the areas below — it explains *why* each piece exists,
not just what it does.

**Golden rules for anyone (human or AI) working on this codebase:**
1. Never edit the vendor baseline commit. All custom work happens in commits
   layered on top of it (see `git log`).
2. Every schema change is a migration — never hand-edit the database schema.
3. Every new/changed calculation that touches money, stock, or totals must be
   verified against a real test database before shipping (see "Testing
   approach" below). This app is the financial system of record for a real
   business — a silent rounding or logic error here costs the owner money.
4. Match existing code conventions in the file you're editing (this vendor
   codebase mixes an older Blade/jQuery admin with a newer Vue 3 + Ant
   Design Vue SPA — don't introduce a third style).
5. Keep changes additive and backward-compatible: new nullable columns, new
   optional fields, new routes — never rename or repurpose an existing
   column/route/permission that other code depends on.

## 1. Tracking Ref / Zone / Courier (Sales)

**Why:** The business ships orders via courier and needed to record, per
sale, a courier tracking number, a delivery zone, and which courier
company handled it — with Zone/Courier as reusable, user-manageable
dropdown lists (not free text), so reporting stays clean.

**Schema** — migration
`database/migrations/2026_09_06_000001_add_tracking_zone_courier_to_sales.php`:
- New tables `sale_zones`, `sale_couriers` (id, name, timestamps, soft
  deletes, unique name).
- New columns on `sales`: `tracking_ref` (string, nullable),
  `zone_id`, `courier_id` (nullable FKs, `ON DELETE SET NULL`).

**Backend:**
- `app/Models/SaleZone.php`, `app/Models/SaleCourier.php` — new, trivial
  models.
- `app/Models/Sale.php` — added the 3 columns to `$fillable`, `zone_id`/
  `courier_id` to `$casts`, and `zone()`/`courier()` `belongsTo` relations.
- `app/Http/Controllers/SaleMetaController.php` — new controller.
  `GET sale_meta` returns `{zones, couriers}` for the dropdowns.
  `POST sale_zones` / `POST sale_couriers` implement the "type a new name,
  press Enter" quick-add used by `CreatableSelect.vue` — `firstOrNew` +
  restore-if-trashed, so re-adding a soft-deleted name doesn't collide with
  the unique constraint.
- `app/Http/Controllers/SalesController.php` — touched in these methods
  only: `index` (list + zone/courier filters + zone_name/courier_name per
  row), `store`, `update` (persist the 3 fields), `create`, `edit` (return
  the zone/courier option lists + current values), `show` (Sale Detail
  page data), `Sale_PDF` / `Sale_PDF_Inline` (kept in step with `show`).
- `app/Http/Controllers/ReportController.php` — Sales Report
  (`Report_Sales`) gained the same 3 columns/filters and returns
  `zones`/`couriers` for its filter dropdowns.
- Routes added in `routes/api.php`, inside the existing authenticated
  `sales` route group: `sale_meta`, `sale_zones`, `sale_couriers`.

**Frontend:**
- `resources/src/components/CreatableSelect.vue` — new, generic. A
  searchable `<a-select>` where typing a new name and pressing Enter (or
  the `+` button) POSTs to `createEndpoint`, adds the result to the local
  options list, and selects it. Reused for both Zone and Courier — don't
  fork it, extend props if a third lookup like this is ever needed.
- `resources/src/pages/sales/Sales.vue` — 3 new list columns
  (`tracking_ref`, `zone_name`, `courier_name`), plain `dataIndex` columns
  so the existing Excel/PDF export (which just serializes the columns
  array) picked them up with no extra work.
- `resources/src/pages/sales/SaleForm.vue` — 3 new fields next to Sales
  Agent (Tracking Ref text input, Zone/Courier `CreatableSelect`).
  `zoneOptions`/`courierOptions` refs are populated from whichever
  bootstrap endpoint loaded (`sales/create`, `sales/{id}/edit`, or the
  quotation-conversion endpoint).
- `resources/src/pages/sales/SaleDetails.vue` — top info block shows
  Warehouse/Tracking Ref/Zone/Courier when present (`v-if`, so it never
  shows an empty row).
- `resources/src/pages/reports/SalesReport.vue` — same 3 columns +
  Zone/Courier filter selects, same `opts()` pattern as the existing
  Warehouse/Customer filters.

## 2. Zone / Courier Report (new report page)

**Why:** A dedicated view answering "which zone/courier carries the most
volume and outstanding balance" — the Sales Report's row-per-sale view
doesn't answer that at a glance.

- `app/Http/Controllers/ReportController.php@zoneWiseReport` — new method.
  Groups `sales` (same date-range/warehouse filters as `Report_Sales`) by
  `zone_id` and, separately, by `courier_id`, via `leftJoin` +
  `COALESCE(..., 'Unassigned')` so sales with no zone/courier still show
  up in one bucket instead of vanishing from the totals. Permission reuses
  `Reports_sales` (it's a variant of the Sales Report, not a new
  permission).
- Route: `GET report/zone_wise` (`routes/api.php`, same auth group as
  `report/sales`).
- `resources/src/pages/reports/ZoneWiseReport.vue` — new page, two
  independent `a-table`s (Zone, Courier) with their own Excel/PDF export
  buttons (uses `lib/exporters.js` directly rather than the full
  `ReportPage`/`useCrudTable` machinery, since this is a small aggregated
  dataset, not a paginated row list).
- Registered in `resources/src/router/index.js`
  (`/reports/zone-wise`) and `resources/src/config/menu.js` (legacy-path
  mapping `/app/reports/zone_wise_report` + a Reports submenu entry,
  label key `Zone_Courier_Report` — **not yet in the translations table**,
  so it currently renders as that literal string; add a proper translation
  row if/when polishing labels).

## 3. Box quantity per sale line

**Why:** The business packs orders into physical boxes and wants to record
"this line's quantity was N boxes" (e.g. quantity 12, box_qty 1) —
informational only, not used in any stock/costing calculation.

**Schema** — migration
`database/migrations/2026_09_07_000001_add_box_qty_to_sale_details.php`:
new nullable `decimal(10,2)` column `box_qty` on `sale_details`.

**Backend** (`app/Models/SaleDetail.php`, `SalesController.php`):
- Added to `SaleDetail`'s `$fillable`/`$casts`.
- Threaded through every place a sale line is read or written: `store`,
  `update` (both save it from the incoming line payload), `edit` (Edit
  Sale form prefill), `show` (Sale Detail page), `Sale_PDF` /
  `Sale_PDF_Inline` (PDF/print), and the new `Sale_Packing_List`.
- **This is intentionally NOT part of any cost/inventory calculation** —
  it never appears in `PurchaseDetail`, `get_average_cost_by_product`, or
  `CalculatesCogsAndAverageCost`. If a future feature wants box_qty to
  affect stock math, that's a deliberate new decision, not something this
  column already assumes.

**Frontend:**
- `resources/src/pages/sales/SaleForm.vue` — new "Box" column in the
  product line-items table (an `a-input-number`), between Net Unit Price
  and Stock. Defaults to `null` for a newly added line; flows through
  automatically for Edit Sale via the `...d` spread when mapping backend
  line data onto `lines.value`.
- `resources/src/pages/sales/SaleDetails.vue` — "Box" column in the items
  table (shows `—` when null).
- `resources/views/pdf/sale_pdf.blade.php` — "Box" column in the invoice
  PDF, next to Qty.

## 4. Sale Detail page — compact info layout

**Why:** Adding Warehouse/Tracking Ref/Zone/Courier as more rows in a
single-column `<table>` pushed the page height way down and left a lot of
dead white space next to the (short) logo column.

- `resources/src/pages/sales/SaleDetails.vue` — the `.inv-meta` block
  changed from a `<table>` (one row per fact) to a CSS Grid
  (`grid-template-columns: repeat(2, auto)`), so the same facts lay out
  in ~half the vertical space on desktop. Below 640px width it collapses
  back to a single column (unchanged mobile behavior) via a media query.
  This is pure layout — no data or logic changed, and `window.print()`
  automatically reflects it since Print renders this same page.

## 5. Shipping Label & Packing List (new PDFs)

**Why:** Two more documents the warehouse/courier workflow needs, distinct
from the full invoice: a small label to stick on the parcel, and a
prices-free list for whoever physically packs the order.

- `app/Http/Controllers/SalesController.php@Sale_Shipping_Label` /
  `@Sale_Packing_List` — new methods, added right after `Sale_PDF`.
  **Deliberately have no `authorizeForUser` call** — this matches every
  other sibling method in that same "Print & PDF" route block
  (`Sale_PDF`, `Quotation_pdf`, `Purchase_pdf`, etc.), which all sit
  outside the `auth:api` middleware group by original vendor design. Don't
  add an auth check to only these two without adding it to the whole
  block — that would be an inconsistent, confusing halfway fix.
- Routes in `routes/api.php`: `sale_shipping_label/{id}`,
  `sale_packing_list/{id}` — added next to `sale_pdf/{id}` in the same
  unguarded "Print & PDF" section for the reason above.
- New blade views: `resources/views/pdf/shipping_label.blade.php` (sender/
  receiver blocks + a COD amount banner shown only when
  `payment_status !== 'paid'`), `resources/views/pdf/packing_list.blade.php`
  (product/code/qty/box table, no prices).
- `resources/src/pages/sales/SaleDetails.vue` — two new toolbar buttons
  next to the PDF button, each just downloading from the routes above.

## 6. Sales list — bulk actions + Qty column

**Why:** With many sales selected via the existing bulk-delete checkboxes,
the business wanted to bulk-print invoices/labels and bulk-set shipping
status/zone/courier instead of doing it one sale at a time. Also wanted a
per-row total quantity column.

**Backend** (`app/Http/Controllers/SalesController.php`):
- `index()` — added `->withSum('details', 'quantity')` to the existing
  query and exposed it as `total_qty` per row (a single extra `SUM`
  subquery, no N+1).
- `renderSaleInvoiceHtml($id)` — new **private** helper. It is the exact
  data-building + Arabic-glyph-fix logic from `Sale_PDF`, extracted so it
  can be called once per sale in a loop. **`Sale_PDF` and `Sale_PDF_Inline`
  themselves were deliberately left untouched** (still have their own copy
  of this logic) rather than refactored to call the new helper — those are
  proven, high-traffic methods, and even a careful extract-method carries
  some risk; duplicating ~110 lines once was judged the safer trade next to
  touching them. If they're ever revisited, folding all three onto one
  helper would remove the duplication.
- `Sale_PDF_Bulk(Request $request)` — `GET sale_pdf_bulk?ids=1,2,3`. Loops
  `renderSaleInvoiceHtml()` per id, joins the HTML with a
  `page-break-after` div between each, renders ONE PDF containing every
  selected invoice back-to-back.
- `Sale_Shipping_Label_Bulk(Request $request)` — `GET
  sale_shipping_label_bulk?ids=1,2,3`. Same idea for the label template.
- `bulkUpdate(Request $request)` — `POST sales_bulk_update` with
  `{selectedIds, shipping_status?, zone_id?, courier_id?, tracking_ref?}`.
  Only the keys actually present in the request are written, so e.g.
  sending just `zone_id` never touches shipping_status on those rows.
- **Important gotcha found and fixed while building this**:
  `resources/views/pdf/sale_pdf.blade.php` declares a plain PHP function
  (`formatPrice`) inline in an `@php` block. That's harmless when the view
  renders once per request (every existing usage), but
  `renderSaleInvoiceHtml()` calls `view('pdf.sale_pdf', ...)->render()`
  once per selected sale **in the same request**, so the second render hit
  "Cannot redeclare formatPrice()" — a hard fatal, caught by testing this
  feature against a real database before shipping (see "Testing approach"
  below), not something that would show up in casual manual testing with
  only one invoice at a time. Fixed by wrapping the declaration in
  `if (! function_exists('formatPrice')) { ... }`. Any other blade view
  that declares a bare function and might ever be rendered more than once
  per request needs the same guard.
- Bulk PDF/label routes sit in the same unguarded "Print & PDF" route
  block as `sale_pdf/{id}` etc. (see section 5 above for why); `bulkUpdate`
  is a normal authenticated route next to `sales_delete_by_selection`.

**Frontend** (`resources/src/pages/sales/Sales.vue`):
- New "Qty" column (`total_qty`, plain `dataIndex`, so it's included in
  export automatically like the others).
- `zoneOptions`/`courierOptions` are `ref([])`, kept in sync from
  `crud.payload` via a `watch` (not `computed` — `CreatableSelect`'s
  "+ add new" needs a mutable list it can push into via
  `v-model:options`, which a computed ref can't accept).
- `<DataTable>`'s existing `#toolbar` slot (already used for the built-in
  bulk-delete button) now also renders "Print Invoices", "Print Labels",
  and "Update Selected (N)" whenever `crud.selectedIds.value.length > 0`.
  "Update Selected" opens a modal (Shipping Status select, Zone/Courier
  `CreatableSelect`, Tracking Ref input) that POSTs only the fields the
  user actually touched to `sales_bulk_update`.

## Known follow-ups (not done, intentionally)

- "Zone / Courier Report" menu label (`Zone_Courier_Report`) has no
  translation row yet — cosmetic only.
- Zone/Courier Report has no per-row drill-down (click a zone to see its
  sales) — out of scope when built; ask before adding if it comes up.

## Testing approach used for every change above

No local Laravel install existed for iterating against, so each backend
change was verified against a real, disposable MySQL database before
delivery: run `php artisan migrate` from a clean schema, then exercise the
actual controller methods (not mocks) via `php artisan tinker` — create
real `Sale`/`SaleDetail`/`Purchase` rows, call `SalesController@index`,
`@store`, `@update`, `@edit`, `@show`, `@Sale_PDF`, etc. directly, and
assert the JSON/HTML response contains the expected fields. The FIFO vs.
average-cost review in this same conversation was verified the same way:
real purchase/sale rows at known costs, run through
`CalculatesCogsAndAverageCost::calcCogsAndAvgCostFast`, and check the
result against a hand-computed expected COGS. Any future change to
`SalesController`, `PurchasesController`, or the cost-calculation trait
should be checked the same way before shipping — this app's calculations
being wrong is a business-critical failure, not a cosmetic bug.
